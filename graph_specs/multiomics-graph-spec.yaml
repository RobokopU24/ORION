    graph_description: 'The Electronic Health Record (EHR) May Treat KP is created and maintained by the Multiomics Provider team from the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, WA. This May Treat KP provides a knowledge graph pointing from medications to a variety health outcomes specifically for diseases prior of treatments. We use data from over 28 million EHRs to train a large collection of interpretable machine learning models which are integrated into a single large knowledge graph. The edges of the graph are generated by running ~300 logistic regression models for clinical conditions with features including age, sex, medical conditions, and medications as nodes to predict associations with disease outcome.'
